# Introduction

Learning quantum computing is no easy feat specially when you combine it with another complicated topic such as high-performance computing. For this reason we have created four suggested pathways that you can utilize to go thorugh the materials here depending on your background.

## Pathways 

#### Quantum Pathway
__Background:__ This Pathway is for those who __have__ HPC experience and would like to leanre the basics of Qiskit and Quantum computing so they can start exploting quantum workflows. Familiarity with Python and/or C++ is preferred as wellk as some comfortability with Unix-like systems and bash scripts.
