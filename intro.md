# Introduction

Learning quantum computing is no easy feat specially when you combine it with another complicated topic such as high-performance computing. For this reason we have created four suggested pathways that you can utilize to go thorugh the materials here depending on your background.

## Pathways 

:::::{dropdown} __Quantum Pathway__
#### Quantum Pathway
__Background:__ This Pathway is for those who __have__ HPC experience and would like to leanre the basics of Qiskit and Quantum computing so they can start exploting quantum workflows. Familiarity with Python and/or C++ is preferred as well as some comfortability with Unix-like systems and bash scripts.

:header: __I.Intro to Quantum Computing__
:link: https://hpc-quantum.github.io/Documentation-website/hpcintro/
This docs page will guide you to the appropriate Qiskit tutorials to start your Quantum journey!
:::

:::{card} 
:header: __II.Intro to Quantum-HPC__
:link: https://hpc-quantum.github.io/Documentation-website/hybrid/
This docs page will guide you through the theory of how a hybrid workflow should work!

After completing the three lessons above feel free to visit the [Python](/Python.md), [C++](https://hpc-quantum.github.io/Documentation-website/cplusplus/), and API demo pages at your own pace. We do reccomend you grasp the content of the C++ basics page before proceeding to the demo content.

#### HPC Pathway 
__Background:__ This Pathway is for those who __have__ quantum computing experience and would like to learn the basics of High Performance computing before delving into hybrid workflows. Familiarity with Qiskit is expected.

#### Beginner Pathway
__Background:__ This Pathway is for those who __don't__ have experience in either HPC & quantum computing. The introduction sectiosn will redirect you to appropriate begginer materials before you come back for the hybrid workflow content on the rest of our page.
