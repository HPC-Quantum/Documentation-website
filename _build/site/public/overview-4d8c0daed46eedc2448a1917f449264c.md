__Welcome to the beginning of your Quantum-HPC journey!__

The following pages provide tutorials on how to use Qiskit for quantum compiutation along side high-performance computing materials. Wether you are new or a seasoned vet on either of these fields we hope that you find the material here usefule and good reference for your research and/or implementations. The content is split into two sections: 

- __Introduction section__ These point towards introductory & free  resources for Quantum Computing with Qiskit and High-Performance computing with Python & C++. 
- __Tutorial section__ These include tutorials on how to install the Qiskit C Api and how to run introductory HPC jobs for Python & C++ with SLURM, a common HPC scheduler [^myref]. In addition this section includes guidance on the installation and implementation of the offical Qiskit C API demo with MPI and OpenMP use released by IBM at the end of 2025. 

[^myref]: No worries if you dont know what this is yet!

:::{note}
All materials here where developed for the Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program by Group #32- Hello HPC!
