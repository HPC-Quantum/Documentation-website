# Hello HPC! - Python

This content was created for FSU's Reserach Computing Center [here](https://docs.rcc.fsu.edu/software/qiskit/). Therefore all module loads must be edited to your system specifications but we provide these here as a guide and offer alternatives. througout the documentation.


Most High-Performance Computing Centers will encourage you to create a virtual environment to handle your dependencies and package installs. Therefore we begin with the instructions for installing qiskit both in uv and conda environments below

## Running Qiskit in UV

The following commands describe the installation for Qiskit using uv:
```bash
$ conda deactivate # Deactivate existing conda environment
$ module load webproxy # Enable Internet access
$ module load python-uv # Load the uv module
$ uv venv ~/quantum  # Name of your environment (can be anything)
$ source ~/quantum/bin/activate # Activate the environment


# Install your packages
$ uv pip install qiskit
$ uv pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
```

## Running Qiskit in a Conda environment

The following commands describe the installation in a Conda environment:
```bash
$ module load anaconda # Load the conda module
$ conda create -n quantum  # Name of your environment (can be anything)
$ conda activate quantum # Activate the environment

# Install your packages
$ conda install conda-forge::qiskit-ibm-runtime
$ conda install conda-forge::qiskit
```

## IBM Quantum Cloud job submission
If you want to submit jobs to real quantum devices on IBM Quantum Cloud or other quantum hardware providers, load the __webproxy module__ or equivalent for your HPC resource so your job can access the Internet, submit your quantum circuits, and extract the results.

Use the following example script as a starting point:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J qiskit-job
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00
#SBATCH -A genacc_q
#SBATCH -n 1

module load webproxy

# Load your environment (include ONLY one of the following options)

# Option 1 - uv environment
source ~/quantum/bin/activate

# Option 2- conda environment
module load anaconda
source activate ~/.conda/envs/quantum

# Run your Python file 
python3 code.py 
```

You must load your IBM credentials inside the file code.py. For instructions on how to configure your IBM Quantum account and how to save your credentials, refer to the official documentation:
